# Create your own podlet footer!

You have now gone through the process of creating a podlet, a layout and put the podlet inside the layout. Alongside this, you have learned how to add the Fabric design system to the project.

Almost every website has a footer where they put other links, contact details, copyright information, or other data. It is time to try to put the skills to test and create your own podlet, the footer, and put it inside the layout.

Create your own footer and put your contact details there, style it with Fabric, and put it inside the layout. It is not important if the footer is not at the bottom of the page.

### Information

As mentioned earlier, Fabric's classes are based on tailwindcss, but with some configuration.

Many CSS classes can be found here: [https://css.fabric-ds.io/](https://css.fabric-ds.io/)

Tailwind's page can be found here: [https://tailwindcss.com/](https://tailwindcss.com/) (most classes will work, but not all)
