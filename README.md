# Your FINN Marketplace

This is intended as a workshop where you create your own Podlets and Layouts by using [Podium](https://podium-lib.io/), an open source micro frontend project develoepd at Finn. This will result in a header, body and footer of a page.

You will also be learning to use Finn's design system, [Fabric](https://www.fabric-ds.io/), which is based on [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

In the end we will create a simple React application out of the header, bundle the code and statically insert it into the server (Podlet).
